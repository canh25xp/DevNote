# Perforce command line `p4` setup guide

## Windows

### Installation

Quick check

#### Use `P4V`

If you already have `P4V` installed, chances are you already have `p4` too.
Check the default install location `C:\Program Files\Perforce`

```ps1
ls 'C:\Program Files\Perforce\p4.exe'
```

You should see:

```
    Directory: C:\Program Files\Perforce

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---            5/9/2025 12:44 PM        9715088 p4.exe
```

Then all left todo is add the `C:\Program Files\Perforce` to `PATH` environment variable.

#### Install `p4` separately
