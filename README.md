# Dev Note

> A collection of notes about basically everything throughout my journey as a S/W developer
> Meant to be used with [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), or as a neovim plugin [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim)

Not the best Arrangement that I came up with, but here a quick overview of what you can expect for each folder

> [!NOTE]
>
> - What goes to **Commands**, what goes to **Guides** ?
>     - If it's complex, require multiple steps and involve several tools to archive a goal, then it goes in **Guides**
>     - If it's Simple, can be done in a 1 commands or 2, then just put it in **Commands**
> - **Random** only meant for temporary notes, when I have not yet decided where to put it.
